## General Information
- The purpose of this project/assignment is to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanom, a type of skin cancer, accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths and can be deadly if not detected early. 

- The dataset used consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.
